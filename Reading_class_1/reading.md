in this reading we will describe the main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python and
explain the concept of time complexity and space complexity.

## Pain and Suffering

Beginners do not have a background knowledge about most of the things they want to learn
Therefore, they will have difficulty learning and will have to spend more time, which will affect them negatively
Learning the Python language is not easy and it takes time and lack of previous experience or lack of understanding of the basics will cause many pressures on the learner, especially when programming errors occur.

so to solve this i Suggest to the learner to find a good source for learning the basics, eg : [w3schoole](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)
You focus on the data types and here method thats will help you and macke you faster in solving proplems 
also when error occur you can ask in the web or search , becouse someone else have the same error befor
last thing write a note in you'r language about what you learne , dont forget to have a rest .

Time and Space Complexity in Data Structure

### Time complexity
Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. It measures the time taken to execute each statement of code in an algorithm. It is not going to examine the total execution time of an algorithm. Rather, it is going to give information about the variation (increase or decrease) in execution time when the number of operations (increase or decrease) in an algorithm. Yes, as the definition says, the amount of time taken is a function of the length of input only.

### space complexity
When an algorithm is run on a computer, it necessitates a certain amount of memory space. The amount of memory used by a program to execute it is represented by its space complexity. Because a program requires memory to store input data and temporal values while running, the space complexity is auxiliary and input space.

## mutable and immutable data types in Python
### Mutable Definition
Mutable is when something is changeable or has the ability to change. In Python, ‘mutable’ is the ability of objects to change their values. These are often the objects that store a collection of data.


### Immutable Definition
Immutable is the when no change is possible over time. In Python, if the value of an object cannot be changed over time, then it is known as immutable. Once created, the value of these objects is permanent.
