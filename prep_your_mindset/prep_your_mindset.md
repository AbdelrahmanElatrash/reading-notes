## summary
As a software developer, when I started learning, skills had to be developed
At first I limited myself to learning the language and solving algorithms
Sometimes I had difficulty with that and needed help and watched videos from YouTube
Then I learned to search in the decomposition and find other ways to solve the problem and use what someone else built
After that, I found  I had to learn other things to support my work, such as dealing with databases and things related to the network
Work continues to develop skills
